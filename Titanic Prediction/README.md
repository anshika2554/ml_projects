## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Clean and analyze real-world data
- Perform feature engineering
- Train and evaluate multiple classification models
- Interpret model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report

---

## 📄 Dataset

- The dataset used is the famous [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) from Kaggle, containing features such as:

  - PassengerId, Name, Sex, Age, Pclass
  - SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked
  - Survived (target variable)

- Also uploaded in the titanic folder.

## 🧠 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Performance evaluation using accuracy score and confusion matrix
